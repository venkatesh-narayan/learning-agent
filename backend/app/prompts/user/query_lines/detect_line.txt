- Whether it builds on current understanding
- If it serves the same learning goal
- Whether it represents natural knowledge building

Provide specific reasoning about:
1. Learning progression connection
2. Goal alignment
3. Understanding development
4. Knowledge building path

Return your analysis as a QueryLineContext object.
