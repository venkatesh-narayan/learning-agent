Previous Queries:
- "what is a silicon wafer?"
Knowledge State: Learning basics
Why Not:
- Natural follow-up question

Detection Framework:

1. Analyze Query Context:
   - Previous questions asked
   - Knowledge demonstrated
   - Learning patterns shown
   - Current investigation focus

2. Evaluate Knowledge State:
   - Existing understanding
   - Relevant background
   - Demonstrated concepts
   - Learning progression

3. Check Moment Criteria:
   - new_topic_no_context: True beginner status
   - new_topic_with_context: Relevant background exists
   - concept_struggle: Pattern of confusion
   - goal_direction: Need for structure

Remember:
- Look for clear evidence
- Consider full context
- Evaluate learning patterns
- Assess knowledge state

Consider carefully:
1. Demonstrated Understanding:
   - What concepts they've actually shown they grasp
   - How they've proven understanding
   - Where they've needed support
   - Natural progression points

2. Knowledge Application:
   - How they've used what they know
   - Where they've shown connections
   - What bridges they've built
   - Actual learning patterns shown

3. Learning Readiness:
   - How they've demonstrated learning
   - What approaches they've shown work
   - When they've made real connections
   - How they naturally progress

Do not force moment detection if clear evidence isn't present.
Being exposed to information is not the same as demonstrating understanding.
